This package, Deep renormalized Mori-Zwanzig (DrMZ) contains the various submodules for generating data and training operator neural networks, finding custom basis functions, solving PDEs using the custom basis functions, and constructing reduced order models.

This repository is currently private and in a pre-release state.

## Adding this package as an invited collaborator:
 
To add the package from GitHub link using Julia REPL:

``` ] add http_link_to_GitHub_repository ```

To add the package from direct download from GitHub using Julia REPL:

``` ] add path_to_GitHub_repository_download_location ```

## Accessing the in-progress documentation:

[Documentation](index.md) complete with working links to the source.

This will eventually be hosted via GitHub Pages once the repository is made public.

## Running an example operator neural network:

Under the ```examples\advection_advection_diffusion_opnn``` directory there is an example script for the advection and advection-diffusion equation. The example script, ```advection_advection_diffusion_opnn.jl```, generates the data set, trains the neural network, and outputs a few results. To run this script, there are several additional packages that need to be installed in addition to the ```DrMZ``` package. To add these packages using Julia REPL:

``` ] add Parameters, LaTeXStrings, ColorSchemes, Plots, PyPlot ```

In this same folder there is also example data for a model trained for 25000 epochs. If you only want to look at the data, in the script just comment out lines 125 and 126.
