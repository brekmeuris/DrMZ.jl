This module contains the various libraries for my disseration work. It includes
    files for generating and training operator neural nets, finding the custom
    basis functions, solving PDEs using the custom basis functions, and
    construction of reduced order models.

Make sure the location of this file is specified in your Julia LOAD_PATH is you
are working locally.

To add a location: push!(LOAD_PATH, "/Users/me/myjuliaprojects")

Add this to your startup file also, "~/.julia/config/startup.jl"
